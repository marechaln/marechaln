- ðŸ‘‹ Hi ! My name is Nicolas
- Here are just few lines about who i am
- I'm currently developper for Orange, with strong focuses on Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, API servers, Cloud Engineering.
- Beside this, i'm 40 years old, have 2 kids, living in France, and have deep interests in sciences (especially mathematics and astrophysics), coding & computing, cooking, sports (swimming, climbing, ...) and rock !!!
- Regarding coding, I'm interesting in cultivating 34 years of experience, passion and culture around coding and computing that came from the first Amstrad CPC6128 offered by my parents around 1987.
- I mostly enjoy programming, seen as a challenge or puzzle: bringing almost anything in whatever adapted language to achieve goals quickly, efficiently and reliently.
- However, as I strongly believe in collective intelligence & efficiency as well as in simplicity and abstraction, I'm never trying to become an expert of any specific language or framework, excepted for professional or specific needs/reasons.
